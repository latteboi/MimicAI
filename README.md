# MimicAI (Beta v0.1)

Designed with Vision, Built by AI.

---

# The Vision
MimicAI is an experiment in AI Development (via Google AI Studio). The entire codebase was architected and generated by Artificial Intelligence, directed by creative vision (myself) focused on providing a convenient and feature-rich user experience.

While the internal structure utilises a modular Mixin architecture, it remains a high-functioning monolithic system optimised for high performance and low resource consumption on local or cloud-based hardware.

# Key Features
*   Google Gemini & OpenRouter Integration: Seamless access to Google's latest models and OpenRouter's vast model library.
*   Zero-Knowledge Privacy: Every profile and its data is encrypted with AES-256 (Fernet) before touching the disk. Only your instance has the key.
*   Three-Layer Memory: Short-Term (Conversation), Long-Term (AI Summaries), and Training Examples (User-defined personality).
*   50-in-1 Bot: Automatic webhook management gives every profile a distinct name and avatar in Discord without needing to create other bot applications.
*   Individual Presence: Manage multiple "Child Bots" from a single process, allowing distinct profiles to live in your server member list via separate bot applications.
*   Regular Sessions: Select from 1 to 10 different profiles to respond to user messages in a designated channel. 
*   Freewill Sessions: Opt-in profiles to start their own conversations, respond by set chance, or respond to keywords.
*   Data Portability: Seamlessly move your profiles between instances using the built-in plaintext Export and Import system.
*   Grounding (Web Search): Integrated Google Search support allows your profiles to access real-time information and cite sources.
*   Multimodal: Built-in image generation and text-to-speech with Google Gemini models.
*   Advanced Parameters: Fine-tune AI behavior with control over Temperature, Top P, Top K, and OpenRouter-specific penalties.

# Deep Dives

# Multimodal Image Generation
MimicAI features a sophisticated pipeline.

*   The Workflow: When a user requests an image via `!image/!imagine`, the bot first generates visual data using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.
*   Contextual Awareness: The generated image is then "shown" to the active profile's text model. The profile views the image and provides an in-character comment, presenting it as if they created or found it.
*   Self-Portraits: Descriptions in the Appearance section of a persona are automatically injected into the image prompt if the AI detects the user is asking for a picture of the profile.

# Grounding (Web Search)
Profiles are not limited to their training data; they can research the real world.
*   Logic: The bot uses an instructed model to analyse if a user's question requires real-time facts.
*   Source Citation: If research is triggered, the model performs a Google Search, summarises the findings, and can provide clickable citations in the Discord footer.
*   Hybrid Approach: This works with any Gemini or OpenRouter model you select for your profiles, because the Grounding summarisation is always provided as text before the Profile model responds. Summarisations can also be injected into the Image Gen model for enhanced visual accuracy.

# Long-Term Memory (LTM)
The LTM system solves the "infinite context" problem by summarising the past.
*   Summarisation: At user-defined intervals (e.g., every 10 messages), an instructed model summarises the conversation into a concise third-person memory.
*   Semantic Retrieval: These memories are converted into numerical vectors using models/gemini-embedding-001.
*   Efficiency: The system utilises Matryoshka Representation Learning to truncate embeddings to 256 dimensions. This ensures lightning-fast search and minimal disk usage without sacrificing character recall.
*   Privacy Scopes: Memories can be set to Global (remembered everywhere), Server-Exclusive, or User-Exclusive.

# Training Examples
This is the most powerful tool for shaping character voice and ensuring consistent interaction.
*   Style Guides: Users provide specific `User Input` -> `Bot Response` pairs to teach the AI character-specific nuances.
*   Pattern Matching: Like the LTM system, training data is processed through models/gemini-embedding-001 using Matryoshka Representation Learning.
*   Dynamic Injection: The bot matches your current message against your training library to find the most relevant "voice" examples, which are then injected into the character's subconscious instructions.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Create your Discord Bot
1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Click **New Application** and give it a name.
3.  Navigate to the **Bot** tab:
    *   Click **Reset Token** to acquire your **Bot Token**.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents" and toggle **ON** the following:
        *   `PRESENCE INTENT`
        *   `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`
        *   `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`
4.  Navigate to the **OAuth2** tab -> **URL Generator**:
    *   Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`.
    *   Select permissions: `Administrator` OR `Attach Files`, `Send Messages`, `Manage Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Read Message History`, `Embed Links`, `Bypass Slowmode`, `Send Messages in Threads`, `Use External Emojis`, `View Channels`, and `Manage Webhooks`.
    *   Use the generated link to invite the bot to your server.

### 2. Install and Run Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/latteboi/MimicAI.git
    cd MimicAI
    ```
2.  **Run the Setup Utility:**
    *   **Linux/macOS Terminal:** `python3 setup.py`
    *   **Windows CMD:** `python3 setup.py`
3.  Follow the prompts to enter your **Discord Bot Token** and your **Discord User ID**.
    *   *Note: On Linux, the script will offer to install MimicAI as a system service for 24/7 uptime.*

### 3. Configure API Keys
MimicAI is an interface; it requires a "Brain" to function.
1.  **Start the Bot:**
    *   **Windows:** `.venv\Scripts\python.exe BotManager.py`
    *   **Linux/macOS:** `source .venv/bin/activate && python3 BotManager.py`
2.  **Submit Keys:** 
    *   Open a **Direct Message** with your bot in Discord.
    *   Use the command `/settings`.
    *   Select your server and click **Edit Primary Key**.
    *   Paste your **Google AI Studio (Gemini)** or **OpenRouter** API key.
    *   IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended that you use paid-tier API keys for Google Gemini, as most functions, such as LTMs, Training Examples, Grounding, and Image Generation, rely on them and are not heavily restricted by imposed rate limits. While free-tier API keys work, they will degrade the overall experience and cause issues.

### 4. Create and Talk to a Character
1.  **Create a Profile:** In your server, run `/profile create profile_name:detective`.
2.  **Shape the Identity:** Run `/profile manage profile_name:detective`.
    *   Use **Edit Persona** to define their backstory, personality traits, likes, dislikes, and appearance.
    *   Use **Edit Instructions** to define their speech patterns, formatting, and other behaviours.
    *   Use **Edit Appearance** to give them an avatar (via URL) and display name.
    *   TIP: You can send an image inside a Discord channel and copy its URL to use as an avatar for your profile.
3.  **Start a Session:** Run `/session config mode:Regular`.
    *   Select your "detective" profile from the dropdown.
    *   Click **Start / Update Session**.
4.  **Interact:** Simply send a message in the channel to begin the conversation!
    *   `Detective, what do you make of this crime scene?`

# Beta Disclaimers & Outdated Info
As an Open Beta, certain components are still catching up to the rapid structural changes:

*   Help Command: The `/help` command currently displays documentation that may be outdated. It will be rewritten to reflect the latest changes at a later time.
*   SDK Migration: This project is currently in a mixed state between the legacy Google Generative AI SDK and the new Unified Gen AI SDK (v2).
*   Experimental Features: Features like the `Anti-Repetition Critic` add latency and are still being tuned for optimal performance.
*   Due to the AI-Generated nature of this project, there may be bugs and inconsistencies. However, I am actively working to improve the codebase and address any issues.

---

# Future Outlooks
*   Parallel Responses: Adding a new feature where you can switch from sequential turns to chaotic "Real-time" Discord conversations where multiple profiles can speak simultaneously.
*   SDK v2 Full Migration: Completing the transition to the latest AI infrastructure for better compatibility.
